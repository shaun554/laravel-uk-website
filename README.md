- Send coherent history - Make sure each individual commit in your pull request is meaningful. If you had to make multiple intermediate - commits while developing, please [squash] (http://www.git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Rewriting-History#Changing-Multiple-Commit-Messages) them before submitting.
- It is important to add tests to your functionality, even if it is a very simple feature. If it is a UI change, it will be helpful to add a simple screenshot with a brief note so others will know what has changed
- If you want to do more than one thing, send multiple pull requests.

### Coding Standards
As this is a Laravel application, we will be following the [PSR-2](https://github.com/php-fig/fig-standards/blob/master/accepted/PSR-2-coding-style-guide.md) coding standard.
 - Interfaces should NOT be suffixed with Interface, Traits should NOT be suffixed with Trait
 - Class and method names must be descriptive enough with type-hints since we are not enforcing docblocks
 - Ensure that you submit tests that have minimal 100% coverage.
